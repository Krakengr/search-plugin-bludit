Search plugin for Bludit

With this plugin you can search your site for posts that have the searched word(s).<!--more-->

This plugin is based on Bludit's search plugin (https://github.com/bludit/bludit/tree/v3.0/bl-plugins/search), however it makes use of the SQLite database instead of JSON files the original plugins uses. The use of the SQLite database has better support for UTF8.

Make sure your server supports SQLite3 before installing this plugin.
