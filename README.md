This plugin is based on Bludit's search plugin (https://github.com/bludit/bludit/tree/v3.0/bl-plugins/search), however it makes use of the SQLite database instead of JSON files the original plugins uses. The use of the SQLite database has better support for UTF8.

## Installation
Download the plugin.

Copy the folder "db-search" into the folder /bl-plugins/ on the server.

Make sure your server supports SQLite3 before installing this plugin.
